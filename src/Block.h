/*
Blocks are initialised by specifying a type from BlockData::Type.
Information (such as the texture) about the block is obtained via
a lookup in the singleton BlockDatabase.

BlockDatabase has a map of Types and BlockData. So, for example, if
we have a grass block and we want to get the texture to draw it, we
simply call BlockDatabase::getData() and pass the block's type as the
argument. This will return a constant reference to the BlockData object.

This way, each block only needs to have an index, specifying its position
in its chunk (m_id), a block type (m_type), and its damage level (m_damageLevel).
