/*
When using non-blocking TcpSockets, it is important to send
the same packet object over again if TcpSocket.send() returns
sf::Socket::Status::Partial (or if it's unable to send for \
another reason, such as not being ready). We'll use this class
as a wrapperaround all packet sending operations to ensure that
packets are being sent properly, even if it takes several frames
to do so.

See the footnote on the following page for a detailed explanation:
https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/network-socket.php
