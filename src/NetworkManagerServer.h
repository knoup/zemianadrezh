	//Functions -----------------------------------
	//Generally, our recipients are either going to be:
	//one specific recipient,
	//all recipients,
	//or all but one recipient.
	//
	//These functions take in a target recipient, defaulting to nullptr
	//(in getTcpRecipients) or an empty string (in getUDPRecipients),
	//and a boolean, defaulting to false.
	//
	//N.B.: The reason getUDPRecipients() takes a string and not a
	//UdpSocket is because it is possible for two players to have
	//the same IP address (such as when testing two local clients).
	//
	//In such a case, we still need to be able to differentiate
	//them, and this cannot be done via just knowing their IP.
	//However, since two players cannot have the same name, we
	//can safely assume their name uniquely identifies them.
	//
	//If the recipient is null (or an empty string), they will return all
	//possible recipients.
	//If _exclude is false, they will only return the recipient specified.
	//If _exclude is true, they will return all recipients except the one
	//specified.
	//
	//These functions are utilised in the sendPacket() functions.
	std::vector<sf::TcpSocket*> getTCPRecipients(
	  sf::TcpSocket* _recipient = nullptr,
	  bool           _exclude   = false);

	//removeConnection() is used to remove the matching TcpSocket from
	//m_clientConnections as well as the associated IPInfo in m_clientIPs
	void removeConnection(const sf::TcpSocket* _con);

	//---------------------------------------------

	//Data members --------------------------------
	//Note: the reason we have m_clientConnections and m_clientIPs in seperate
	//data structures is because when sf::TcpListener accepts a socket, we only
	//have access to the socket, and can't send or access any other data alongside
	//it (in our case, we need the player's name and port the client is using).
	//When a connection is accepted, it is pushed back to m_clientConnections.
	//
	//When a client sends a JUST_JOINED packet, we can then send data with it - the
	//player's name and port. It is then that the IPInfo containing the player's
	//name and client's port is pushed back to m_clientIPs.
