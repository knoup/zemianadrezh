	Similar to the behaviour in NetworkManagerClient, we're going to have 4
	FunctionBinder objects which we'll use to map packet types to callback
	functions.

	The receivers will take in a pointer to the packet to extract relevant
	information from, and a pointer to the TcpSocket uniquely identifying
	the client.

	The senders will take in a reference to a vector of shared packet ptrs
	instead. This is because some callbacks will require multiple packets
	be sent (such as when sending the world, one chunk at a time). After
	all the packets have been prepared, they will be sent in the
	::sendPacket functions. They will also take in a TcpSocket ptr speci-
	fying the intended recipient, which needs to be known in certain cases
	(such as to avoid sending a client's own player data back to them).
