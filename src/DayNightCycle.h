/*
This class handles everything to do with the VISUAL effects of the day-night cycle, including:

-The sun/moon's position
-Shaders

Just give it a world, and it will handle everything else. It inherits from sf::Drawable so as
to decouple the aesthetic portions of the day-night cycle from everything else. Simply draw it.

Saving this for future reference:
